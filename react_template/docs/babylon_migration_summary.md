# Babylon.js Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration process from Three.js to Babylon.js in the Virtual Backlot prototype application. The migration was completed successfully, with all functionality preserved and enhanced through Babylon.js's advanced features.

## Key Changes

### 1. Package Dependencies
- Added core Babylon.js packages:
  - `@babylonjs/core` - Core rendering engine
  - `@babylonjs/loaders` - For loading glTF/GLB models

### 2. Component Structure
- Created new `BabylonJsRenderer` component to replace `ThreeJsRenderer`
- Maintained the same component interface and ref-exposed methods for seamless integration
- Updated imports in `AssetDetailView.jsx` to use the new Babylon.js renderer

### 3. Renderer Implementation
- **Scene Setup**:
  - Implemented Babylon's engine and scene initialization
  - Created appropriate camera setup (ArcRotateCamera instead of OrbitControls)
  - Established lighting with HemisphericLight and DirectionalLight
  
- **Model Loading**:
  - Used Babylon's SceneLoader for efficient model importing
  - Implemented asset-specific scaling and positioning
  - Created fallback geometries for cases where models fail to load
  
- **Render Quality**:
  - Implemented two rendering modes: "realtime" and "offline" 
  - Added post-processing effects for high-quality renders (SSAO, tone mapping)
  - Enhanced lighting setup for better visual quality

- **Animation Handling**:
  - Utilized Babylon's AnimationGroups for animation playback
  - Implemented play/pause functionality via the component ref

- **Camera Controls**:
  - Implemented camera preset positions (front, top, side, closeup)
  - Maintained camera manipulation interface via the component ref

- **Snapshot Feature**:
  - Utilized Babylon's native canvas capture capabilities
  - Preserved the same snapshot interface as in Three.js implementation

## Implementation Details

### Scene Management
Babylon.js uses a scene-based architecture that centralizes rendering control:
